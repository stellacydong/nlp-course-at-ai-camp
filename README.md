# nlp-course-at-ai-camp

Jupyter notebooks that I created and used to teach NLP course at ai-camp in summer 2021. The summer camp ran for 3 weeks. All the materials would need to be covered within 2 weeks since students had to work on their projects and the deployment. 

This repo. consists 3 parts: basic python coding, data perparation, and modelling. 

### The suggected plan for this program: 

*Phase 1*: Python folder which covers: lists, dictionaries, for loops, conditional statements, classes and objectives, NumPy, and Pandas. 
1) for people who don't have coding experiences at all, start with beginner series, and reinforce the knowledge using the intermeidate series in the python folder.
2) for people who have known basic python knowledge, start with intermidate series in the pyhon folder. 


*Phase 2*: data perparation folder which covers: upload data, clean data, analyze data, and vectorize text data 

*Phase 3*: modeling folder which covers: machine algorithms (perceptron, linear regression, logistic regression, classification, deep learning networks with keras, and pytorch models.)
